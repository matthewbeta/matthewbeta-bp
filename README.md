  #### some compass stuff I need/use all the time

  - _base.scss - general vars and imports
  - _helpers.scss - some cool functions and mixins
  - _grid.scss - a little grid framework (in prog)
  - _sticky-footer - some stuff for making the footer stay down, like a good dog
  - _typo - set all the typographies here
  - style.scss - import all the things and compile just this one to css file.
